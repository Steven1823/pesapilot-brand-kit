Why this repo

Quick usage guide
- Logo: use the correct version for background contrast; preserve clear space equal to the height of the mark.
- Colors: use primary palette for core branding; use secondary palette for accents only.
- Typography: use listed web fonts for headings and body; use specified weights for hierarchy.
- File formats: use SVG for scalable assets; PNG for raster needs; EPS/PDF for print.
