About
Centralized repository of PesaPilot logos, color palettes, typography and usage rules to maintain a consistent brand identity.

Quick start
1. Browse /logos to find the correct logo variant (full, mark-only, reversed).
2. Use SVGs for web and scalable needs; PNG for raster; EPS/PDF for print.
3. Follow the clear-space, contrast and color rules in Usage guidelines before publishing.

Usage guidelines (short)
- Logo
  - Always preserve clear space equal to the mark height.
  - Use reversed logo on dark backgrounds; use mark-only where space is limited.
  - Do not alter colors, stretch, or add effects.
- Colors
  - Use primary palette for core brand elements; secondary palette only for accents.
  - Provide hex/RGB values from /colors/palette.md.
- Typography
  - Use listed web fonts for headings and body; follow weights and sizes in /typography/usage.md.
- Accessibility
  - Ensure sufficient contrast for text and logos against backgrounds.
